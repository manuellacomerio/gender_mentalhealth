Analysis of Gender Influence in the UK Adult Population Mental Health in 2018-2019

### Context
This analysis was submitted as my final assessment for the Quantitative Data Analysis course of my MSc in Urban Analytics. Using the Understanding Society Wave 10 (2018-2019) dataset, the analysis aimed to explore if there is a gender difference in the UK adult population mental health score in the aforementioned year. The 12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12) Mental Component Summary (MCS) is the dependent variable for the OLS models developed and tested. Independent variables were chosen based on a literature review of studies on the main subject of gender and mental health.
